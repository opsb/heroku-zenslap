= Description
  A Ruby interface for getting operating system information. The name comes
  from the Unix 'uname' command, but this library works on Windows as well.

= Installation
  gem install sys-uname

  # If that doesn't work and you're on Windows try this:
  gem install sys-uname --platform x86-mingw32
   
= Synopsis
  require 'sys/uname'
  include Sys
   
  p Uname.uname
   
= Solaris Notes
  Folks building this package on SunOS get two extra methods: architecture()
  and platform()

= BSD flavors, including OS X
  Users on BSD platforms get the extra Uname.model method.

= HP-UX Notes
  HP-UX users get the extra Uname.id_number method.  This is actually a
  String, not a Fixnum, because that's how it's defined in the utsname
  struct.

= MS Windows Notes
  The C version for Windows has been completely scrapped in favor of an OLE
  plus WMI approach.  It is pure Ruby.  Please see the MSDN documentation for
  the Win32_OperatingSystem class for a complete list of what each of the
  UnameStruct members mean.

= Documentation
  For more details, see the 'uname.txt' file under the 'doc' directory.
