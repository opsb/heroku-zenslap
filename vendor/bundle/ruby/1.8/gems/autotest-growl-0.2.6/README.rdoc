== DESCRIPTION:

This gem aims to improve support for Growl notifications by autotest. It
comes  with a nice and colorful icon sets and supports several testing
frameworks on different platforms.

Furthermore the terminal running autotest is cleared on every cycle (unless
configured otherwise). Don't worry though, it's still possible to scroll up
to see the output of previous cycles - at least when using the Terminal.app
bundled with Mac OS X.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* either autotest (recommened) or ZenTest
* Growl >= 1.1.5 on Mac OS X   --OR--
* Growl for Windows >= 2.0b18 on Windows   --OR--
* libnotify >= 0.4.5 on Linux

== INSTALL:

First of all, you have to decide whether you want to use the lightweight
autotest gem (recommended) or the more comprehensive ZenTest gem and install 
either of them:

  sudo gem install autotest     --OR--
  sudo gem install ZenTest

Now install this gem:

  sudo gem install autotest-growl

Then add the following line to your ~/.autotest file:

  require 'autotest/growl'

Growl must be installed on your computer. You can download it from:

Mac OS X: http://growl.info
Windows:  http://growlforwindows.com

On Linux you can use libnotify instead, however, some of the features 
won't work. The binary notify-send must be in your PATH:

Linux:    http://www.galago-project.org

If you like this gem, please consider to recommend me on Working with
Rails, thank you!

== UPDATE FROM 0.1.X

As of version 0.2.X autotest-growl no longer requires the ZenTest gem but
either ZenTest or it's lighter twin autotest (recommended). To update and
switch do the following:

  sudo gem uninstall ZenTest
  sudo gem install autotest
  sudo gem update autotest-growl

To use autotest with Rails, install the autotest-rails-pure gem instead of
the famous autotest-rails gem which requires ZenTest:

 sudo gem uninstall autotest-rails
 sudo gem install autotest-rails-pure

And in case one day you need the more advanced features of ZenTest, install
the zentest-without-autotest gem alongside autotest:

  sudo gem install zentest-without-autotest

== CONFIGURATION:

=== Priorities

The priority of a notification is set according to the actual result so you
can  configure Growl to style the notifications differently based on these
priorities:

* 2 for error or failed
* 0 for info
* -1 for pending, undefined or unknown
* -2 for passed

=== Icons

Two icon sets are bundled with this gem:

* ruby (default): The original Ruby logo dressed in traffic light colors.
* ampelmaennchen: The famous traffic light man from the now extinct GDR.

To choose an icon set, add the following to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::image_dir = 'ampelmaennchen'

Using your own icon set is pretty simple. Images should be named as
follows: passed.png, pending.png, failed.png, error.png and info.png.

Place these images in a directory of your choosing and specify its
location in your ~/.autotest, example:

  Autotest::Growl::image_dir = File.join(ENV['HOME'], '.autotest-growl')

=== Don't Clear the Terminal

Add the following to your ~/.autotest if you don't want the terminal to
be cleared before running a test:

  Autotest::Growl::clear_terminal = false

=== Hide the Label

If you prefer the Growl notifications not to show labels such as "LABEL:
All tests have passed", add the following to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::hide_label = true

=== One Notification per Run

Allow only one test and one feature notification per run by adding the
following to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::one_notification_per_run = true

=== Make Failure and Error Notifications Sticky

If you don't want to miss any failure or error notifications while you 
get a cup of coffee, make them stay on your display until you explicitly
click them away. Simply add the following to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::sticky_failure_notifications = true

=== Show Modified Files

Add the following to your ~/.autotest if you would like to receive a Growl
notification listing the files modified before tests are re-run.

  Autotest::Growl::show_modified_files = true

== TROUBLESHOOTING:

=== Loading the Plugin Seems to Fail

The reason may be ZenTest which must not be installed. See "Update from 
0.1.X" for more on this.

=== Unreliable Growl Notifications on Mac OS X

Under some circumstances, Growl notifications seem to be swallowed randomly
on Mac OS X. If this happens to you, try the following.

Add this to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::remote_notification = true
  
Now open "System Preferences -> Growl -> Network" and set the checkboxes
"Listen for incoming notifications" and "Allow remote application 
registration‚Äù. Try whether remote notifications work with the following
test:

  find /Library/Ruby /usr -name growlnotify -exec {} -H localhost -n autotest -m ok \;
  
If you get a NSPortTimeoutException, you should restart Growl and check
whether a firewall is blocking the connection. Once the notification is 
displayed, go back to the System Preferences and disable the checkbox
"Allow remote application registration" again.

=== No Notifications on Mac OS X 10.5

If you are still on Leopard and notifications don't work for you, get your
hands dirty and remove the "-n Autotest" argument from growl.rb. Make sure
you submit a bug or comment on a related and existing bug, too. 

== DEVELOPMENT:

You can install the bleeding edge version as follows:

  git clone git://github.com/svoop/autotest-growl.git
  cd autotest-growl
  rake build
  sudo rake install
