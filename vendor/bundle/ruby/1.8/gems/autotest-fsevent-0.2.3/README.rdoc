= Autotest FSEvent

== DESCRIPTION:

Autotest relies on filesystem polling to detect modifications in source code 
files. In other words: The filesytem is constantly being traversed which causes
quite some load on both the CPU and the harddrive. This is not healthy for your
Mac and if you are working on a portable computer, it will drain your battery. 
Apple has introduces FSEvent with Mac OS X 10.5 which is a very efficient way 
to have the operating system monitor file alterations. This gem teaches autotest
to use FSEvent and therefore be nice to your Mac.

Unlike other test runners for the Mac, autotest-mac does not replace but
extend autotest and does *not* require RubyCocoa to be installed.

If you are on Linux, you should take a look at the autotest-inotify gem instead:

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Mac OS X >= 10.5
* Xcode
* either autotest (recommened) or ZenTest
* rspec ~> 1.3
* sys-uname

== INSTALL:

In order to compile the fsevent binary at install time, Xcode (Mac OS X
Development Suite) must be installed. You can download it for free from:

http://developer.apple.com

Furthermore you have to decide whether you want to use the lightweight
autotest gem (recommended) or the more comprehensive ZenTest gem and install 
either of them:

  sudo gem install autotest     --OR--
  sudo gem install ZenTest

Now install the gem:

  sudo gem install autotest-fsevent

Then add the following line *after all other requires* in your ~/.autotest
file:

  require 'autotest/fsevent'

If you like this gem, please consider to recommend me on Working with
Rails, thank you!

== UPDATE FROM 0.1.X

As of version 0.2.X autotest-fsevent no longer requires the ZenTest gem but
either ZenTest or it's lighter twin autotest (recommended). To update and
switch do the following:

  sudo gem uninstall ZenTest
  sudo gem update autotest-fsevent

To use autotest with Rails, install the autotest-rails-pure gem instead of
the famous autotest-rails gem which requires ZenTest:

 sudo gem uninstall autotest-rails
 sudo gem install autotest-rails-pure

And in case one day you need the more advanced features of ZenTest, install
the zentest-without-autotest gem alongside autotest:

  sudo gem install zentest-without-autotest

== TROUBLESHOOTING:

=== Compilation of fsevent_sleep Failed

Make sure you have Xcode (Mac OS X Development Suite) installed. You can 
download it for free from:

http://developer.apple.com

=== Loading the Plugin Seems to Fail

The reason may be ZenTest which must not be installed. See "Update from 
0.1.X" for more on this.

== DEVELOPMENT:

You can install the bleeding edge version as follows:

  git clone git://github.com/svoop/autotest-fsevent.git
  cd autotest-fsevent
  rake build
  sudo rake install
